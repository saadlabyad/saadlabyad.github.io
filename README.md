I am a finishing PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Oxford, supervised by Professor Samuel N. Cohen and Professor √Ålvaro Cartea, under the Ioan and Rosemary James scholarship.

My current research interests lie in statistical learning of point processes, and their applications to study high frequency financial data.
